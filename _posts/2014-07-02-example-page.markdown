Intro



What is Machine Learning?

Types of machine learning algorithms:

Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning
Reinforcement learning
Recommender systems



Supervised Learning

Regression

	Predict Continuous Valued output (like prices)

Classification

	Predict discrete valued output (like 0 or 1)

Unsupervised Learning

	




Training set 

Notation:

m - Number of training examples
x’s -  input variables/ features
y’s - outuput variables / ‘target’ variables
(x,y) - One training example
(x(i),y(i)) - ith training example


Hypothesis

Linear regression model

h(0)(x) = O0+O1x

Cost Function
Gradient descent
